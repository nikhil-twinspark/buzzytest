# CakeS3 Plugin for CakePHP 2.0

The CakeS3 plugin for CakePHP allows easy integration with an Amazon S3 instance to be dropped into your app.

Utilising [tpyo's](https://github.com/tpyo/amazon-s3-php-class) amazon-s3-php-class, which in his words is..

> This class is a standalone Amazon S3 REST implementation for PHP 5.2.x (using CURL), that supports large file uploads and doesnâ€™t require PEAR.

This means it can be dropped in and run on a variety of hosting platforms.

## Installation

Do one of the following to use this plugin in your CakePHP 2.0 app

	git clone https://fullybaked@github.com/fullybaked/CakeS3.git app/Plugin/CakeS3

or

	git submodule add https://fullybaked@github.com/fullybaked/CakeS3.git app/Plugin/CakeS3

or

Just download the package and unzip it into your app/Plugin directory


Then remember to add the following to your Config/bootstrap.php

	//Add the CakeS3 plugin
	CakePlugin::load('CakeS3');

## Setup

Add the following to your controller $components instance variable

	// in controller components var
	$components = array(
		'CakeS3.CakeS3' => array(
			's3Key' => 'YOUR_AMAZON_S3_KEY',
			's3Secret' => 'YOUR_AMAZON_S3_SECRET_KEY',
			'bucket' => 'BUCKET_NAME',
			'endpoint' => 's3.amazonaws.com' // [optional] Only required if your endpoint is not s3.amazonaws.com
		)
	);

## Usage

####List the contents of a bucket

	$contents = $this->CakeS3->listBucketContents();

####List the contents of a path relative to the bucket i.e. a folder

	$contents = $this->CakeS3->listFolderContents('path/relative/to/bucket/');

####Upload a file to S3

	$response = $this->CakeS3->putObject('/path/to/local/file', 'path/relative/to/bucket/', [$permission]);

The response value is an array with the following values

	array(
		'name' => [name of saved file],
		'url' => [path to the resource on S3],
		'size' => [size of the resource on S3]
	)

Allowed $permission Values:

The allowed values for permissions are wrapped by the component and are accessed via a wrapper method

	$this->CakeS3->permission('private');
	$this->CakeS3->permission('public_read');
	$this->CakeS3->permission('public_read_write');
	$this->CakeS3->permission('authenticated_read');

Example:

	$response = $this->CakeS3->putObject('/path/to/local/file', 'path/relative/to/bucket/', $this->CakeS3->permission('authenticated_read'));

####Accessing Files With `authenticated_read` Permission

	$auth_path = $this->CakeS3->authenticateUrl($full_s3_path, [$lifetime]);

If a file is stored on S3 with `authenticated_read` permissions, it is only accessible via a secure token.  This method generates a new URL to
reach the resource with the correct token, and a time to live.  The default is 30 seconds as generally the URL will be recreated on refresh, but
not accessible if copied out of the app

####Delete a file from S3

	$response = $this->CakeS3->deleteObject('path/relative/to/bucket/');

####Retrieve an object from S3 location

	$object = $this->CakeS3->getObject('path/relative/to/bucket/', [$path_to_store_local_copy = false]);

####Retrieve information about an object on S3

	$info = $this->CakeS3->getObjectInfo('path/relative/to/bucket/');

####Change the bucket name on the fly using method chaining

	$response = $this->CakeS3->bucket('new_bucket')->{any_of_the_above_methods};
